# zuoz2016-toy-shower

A simple toy parton shower shown at the "PSI Summer School Exothiggs",
Zuoz, August 2016
(https://www.psi.ch/particle-zuoz-school/ltp-zuoz-summer-school), as
part of the "Ingredients for accurate collider physics lectures" by
Gavin Salam.

This is not meant to be a realistic shower, but rather a very basic
illustration of how the core of a shower works.

The shower generates the transverse momenta of all primary emissions
for a colour-singlet system (e.g. Higgs) that is produced by gluon fusion

Many important physical effects are missing:

- energy conservation and the effect of PDFs,
  because the shower works in the soft approximation

- secondary emissions, i.e. the radiated gluons don't themselves
  radiate here

- running coupling

- generation of actual 4-momenta for the emissions (only the
  transverse momenta are generated)

- etc.
